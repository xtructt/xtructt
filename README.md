### Tech Stack:
- ROS1 and Nav stack for robot navigation
- Azure Speech to Text for voice recognition
- OpenAI API for natural language understanding and intent determination

This project demonstrates my practical experience in:
- Robotics system integration
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- AI application in real-world scenarios
- Collaborative development in complex robotic systems
